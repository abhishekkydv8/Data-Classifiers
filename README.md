# Data-Classifiers

Implementation of different types of Machine Learning algorithms.

We use the test set to report the accuracy of different types of Machine Learning algorithms. We use the following algorithm:

--> K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
--> Decision Tree
--> Support Vector Machine
--> Logistic Regression
